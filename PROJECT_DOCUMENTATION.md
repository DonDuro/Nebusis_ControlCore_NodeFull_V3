# NEBUSISÂ® ControlCore Module

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for managing universal internal control framework compliance workflows. The system helps government institutions worldwide track and manage their compliance with five key components: Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Control Activities, Information & Communication, and Monitoring Activities.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with a React frontend and Express.js backend, using PostgreSQL for data persistence and TypeScript throughout for type safety.

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom Tailwind CSS styling
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Validation**: Zod schemas shared between frontend and backend

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The system uses six main entities:
- **Users**: System users with roles (admin, supervisor, user)
- **Institutions**: Government institutions with metadata
- **Workflows**: NOBACI component implementations
- **Workflow Steps**: Individual tasks within workflows
- **Evidence**: Supporting documents and files
- **Institution Documents**: Contextual documents for workflow personalization

### API Structure
RESTful API endpoints organized by domain:
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication and user management
- `/api/workflows/*` - Workflow CRUD operations
- `/api/institutions/*` - Institution management
- `/api/activities/*` - Activity tracking
- `/api/compliance-scores/*` - Compliance scoring
- `/api/documents/*` - Document management and AI analysis

### UI Components
Component library built on Radix UI:
- Layout components (Header, Sidebar)
- Dashboard widgets (StatsCards, WorkflowProgress, RecentActivity)
- Workflow management (WorkflowList, WorkflowDetails)
- Reusable UI primitives (Button, Card, Dialog, etc.)

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: Demo login system using hardcoded user credentials
2. **Institution Context**: User's institution determines available workflows
3. **Workflow Management**: CRUD operations for NOBACI component workflows
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates and compliance scoring
5. **Activity Logging**: Audit trail of all system interactions

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Serverless PostgreSQL client
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI component primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **zod**: TypeScript-first schema validation

### Development Dependencies
- **vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for Node.js
- **esbuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit with the following setup:
- **Development**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend
- **Production Build**: `npm run build` creates optimized bundles
- **Production Server**: `npm start` runs the production server
- **Database**: Automatic PostgreSQL provisioning via Replit modules
- **Environment**: Node.js 20 with web and PostgreSQL modules

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (auto-provisioned)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development/production)

### Port Configuration
- **Development**: Port 5000 for the combined server
- **Production**: External port 80 mapped to internal port 5000

## Authentication System
